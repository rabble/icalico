= acts_as_ferret

This ActiveRecord mixin adds full text search capabilities to any Rails model.

It is heavily based on the original acts_as_ferret plugin done by
Kasper Weibel and a modified version done by Thomas Lockney, which 
both can be found on http://ferret.davebalmain.com/trac/wiki/FerretOnRails

== Installation

=== Installation inside your Rails project via script/plugin

script/plugin install svn://projects.jkraemer.net/acts_as_ferret/trunk/plugin/acts_as_ferret


=== System-wide installation with Rubygems

<tt>sudo gem install acts_as_ferret</tt>

To use acts_as_ferret in your project, add the following line to your
project's config/environment.rb:

<tt>require 'acts_as_ferret'</tt>


== Usage

include the following in your model class (specifiying the fields you want to get indexed):

<tt>acts_as_ferret :fields => [ :title, :description ]</tt>

now you can use ModelClass.find_by_contents(query) to find instances of your model
whose indexed fields match a given query. All query terms are required by default, 
but explicit OR queries are possible. This differs from the ferret default, but 
imho is the more often needed/expected behaviour (more query terms result in 
less results).

Please see ActsAsFerret::ActMethods#acts_as_ferret for more information.
