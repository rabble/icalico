DESCRIPTION:Description: Everyone knows that Google\, Yahoo!\, and many other "Web 2.0" companies are built on top of open source\, but how exactly do they use it?  What's more\, how do they apply principles from open source to other aspects of their business?   How does a Web 2.0 business differ from a traditional software business? In this conversation with Chris DiBona\, Open Source Program Manager for Google\, Jeremy Zawodny\, open source point man in Developer Relations for Yahoo!\, and Jim Buckmaster\, CEO of Craigslist\, we'll explore these topics and more.  We'll also put them in the hot seat:  how do they give back to open source projects when source code alone isn't enough for people to recreate the application?

A mainstay of the Perl side of the convention\, lightning talks are an exciting format and an excellent place to showcase new ideas\, ask questions\, or rant. Lightning talks are a great place for both novice and experienced speakers; a place where you can hone your speaking skills and condense subjects to their most essential bits. They're a great place to ask questions\, talk about lessons you've learned\, showcase new techniques or introduce new projects.Speaker(s): George Schlossnagle; Track: PHPRoom: D136
