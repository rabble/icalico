DESCRIPTION:Description: Web 2.0 is all about user-generated content. But what is your responsibility to your users once they post their personal information on your site? The goal of this talk is to make the business case for prioritizing user privacy protections when building any system that relies on user-generated content. It will highlight some of the laws that affect your users' content\, and will also suggest ideas for how you can design a system from the beginning to build privacy protection in.\nSpeaker(s): Lauren Gelman; \nTrack: Web 2.0 Fundamentals\nRoom: 2008

DESCRIPTION:Description: Publishing to the Web has changed dramatically. In Web 2.0\, information is broken up into "microcontent" units that can be distributed over dozens of domains\, and the "intended" context for your content may only be one of a myriad of places where it ends up.  Web 2.0 designers must learn to think beyond sites and towards experiences\, finding ways to brand content when context cannot be assumed. This session will cover trends in micropublishing\, and explore new approaches to design that take advantage of the nature of the social web.\nSpeaker(s): Alex Faaborg; \nTrack: Design and User Experience\nRoom: 2003

DESCRIPTION:Description: People shop in increasingly complex\, unique\, uncontrollable\, and unpredictable ways. Marketing and sales must work less like a hook and more like Velcro&#151;with thousands of (equally important) contact points. We must remodel how people shop and then rethink how we design interactive experiences. The swirl is a model of consumer behavior that fuses these new realities with the accountability demanded by marketing and sales groups. \nSpeaker(s): Kip Voytek; \nTrack: Design and User Experience\nRoom: 2003
