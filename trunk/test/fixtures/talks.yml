    Description: Everyone's doing it -- the poster children for "Web 2.0" are built on top of the LAMP stack. The next generation of web-based applications are built with free tools, with few people understanding the best way to scale these applications out. But patterns emerged very early on -- all of these applications share some common architectural principles that seem to be working. In this brief state-of-the-world, we'll look at the various approaches to scalable internet application architectures and what we can learn from them.

This approach and attitude is changing dramatically, as traditional media sites are becoming more interactive and aggressively seeking to develop active online readers. Bloggers are getting funded to produce new micropublishing ventures, and other sites like Digg and YouTube are creating new ways for stories and media to be discovered.

    Description: Web 2.0 is all about user-generated content. But what is your responsibility to your users once they post their personal information on your site? The goal of this talk is to make the business case for prioritizing user privacy protections when building any system that relies on user-generated content. It will highlight some of the laws that affect your users' content, and will also suggest ideas for how you can design a system from the beginning to build privacy protection in.

    Description: Publishing to the Web has changed dramatically. In Web 2.0, information is broken up into "microcontent" units that can be distributed over dozens of domains, and the "intended" context for your content may only be one of a myriad of places where it ends up.  Web 2.0 designers must learn to think beyond sites and towards experiences, finding ways to brand content when context cannot be assumed. This session will cover trends in micropublishing, and explore new approaches to design that take advantage of the nature of the social web.

    Description: The Dot Com Nuclear Winter is over, and funding for Web 2.0 startups has never been better. But traditional VCs are now being challenged by a variety of changes to the startup economy. Lower startup capital costs, alternate financing strategies by angels and entrepreneurs, and early takeouts by mergers and acquisitions--hungry platform companies like Yahoo!, Google, and eBay have changed the way the game is being played by startups in the 21st century. So are later-stage VCs toast, or do they still have a relevant role in the startup economy?  Who will be the new winners and losers on Sand Hill Road, and around the world?

In this workshop, led by 2007 O'Reilly Mashup Winner Thomas Howe, we look at how telephony mashups rewrite that equation, and at the implementation details in depth. The attendees will leave with a good understanding of the technology and effort required to write their own compelling application.

    Description: The Web2.Open is a part of the Web 2.0 Expo, open to anyone who would like to attend. The Web2.Open was conceived with FooCamp/BarCamp in mind, blending some pre-scheduled content with an open grid where the attendees fill in the sessions they either want to discuss or present themselves. The Web2.Open will consist of four major elements: open grid sessions, pre-scheduled speaker sessions, BoFs, and Mashroom.

    Description: People shop in increasingly complex, unique, uncontrollable, and unpredictable ways. Marketing and sales must work less like a hook and more like Velcro&#151;with thousands of (equally important) contact points. We must remodel how people shop and then rethink how we design interactive experiences. The swirl is a model of consumer behavior that fuses these new realities with the accountability demanded by marketing and sales groups.
