However, it is becoming just as common to see information presented in small discrete chunks known as \'widgets\'.</p><p>The explosion of social networking sites has created a demand for widgets to add to profiles. Whether it is the last track you played, predictions for your star-sign, or the scores of the team you support, there seems to be a widget for everything. Meanwhile, Google and Yahoo! both have cross-platform desktop-based widget formats, and the growing market-share of Vista is exposing an increasing number of business users to the potential of Vista Gadgets. The rise of widgets poses new IA challenges. How can a client\'s requirements be crammed into such a tiny space? How do you attract and retain audience attention without cluttering the user\'s desktop or Facebook profile?</p><p>This talk examines what makes a successful widget from an information delivery point of view. It also looks at how information professionals can help develop more \'playful\' ways of representing and structuring the information presented. These examples will illustrate how to develop a more engaging user experience, one that stands out from the all-too-common formula of \'information feed + logo + home link = marketing widget\'. </p>','2008-04-14 11:45:00','2008-04-14 12:30:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2008-04-14','2008-04-14','11:45','12:30',1,NULL,1,NULL),(55,'Why markets love the internet (or, the 1 hour MBA for user experience designers and other layabouts)','<p>Since virtually anything can be purchased or traded for on the internet, it’s worth reviewing some basic economic concepts about markets, and how companies try to position themselves within the marketplace online.  We’ll talk about concepts such as information costs, experience goods, lock-in, switching costs, signaling, perfect markets, liquidity, and others, and discuss how they influence user experience design.

Tabbed menus. Drop downs. Form fields. Sure, patterns and conventions are important. But is ‘familiar’ always better? What might be more natural?

The recording is server-side, automated, and transparent to the user. To date, the commercial products based on this capability offer the ability to “playback” individual web browsing sessions, provide rudimentary compilations of summary metrics, and display “heatmap” visualizations of the density of clicks and hovers.</p><p>Our presentation will explore the potential for this capability to provide a new generation of web analytic tools for providing insights into naturalistic user behaviors and design quality.

Instead, the vast majority of content pages online remain more concerned with their own context than the context of their users: where did a user arrive from and where are they likely to go next? These pages remain designed as if they were primarily accessed from a Web site’s home page or a carefully thought-out selection from the site’s information architecture. </p><p>To address these issues and more, this talk outlines a set of best practices for Web content page design that focuses on appropriate presentations of content, context, and calls to action. Specifically: how can content be optimised to meet user expectations as they arrive from a diverse number of access points; what is the minimum amount of context required to frame content appropriately; how can the most relevant calls to action be presented to maximize user engagement?

But there are other phases of the design process where storytelling can augment methods. During user research sharing stories connect us with our subjects. Storytelling helps teams collaborate. When we articulate concepts we can establish credibility by telling a story. It’s especially compelling as an adjunct to diagrams and numbers -- a good story can facilitate buy-in and approval of solutions. From problem definition to research, team building to communication, stories are a winning tool to gain consensus, improve collaborative relationships and create user experiences that resonate.</p><p>This presentation will demonstrate how to combine storytelling techniques with the user-centered methodologies we are already practicing.

The next wave of tagging systems impose more structure and accept less ambiguity in tags. \n</li><li>A pace for all layers.  Pace layering suggests that tags are a fast-moving form of metadata, while facets and taxonomies are more stable, slower layers.  But recent research and practice suggest that tagging patterns are often quite stable, and that tagging systems can operate across multiple pace layers.\n</li><li>Automanual folksonomies. While most folksonomies are generated by analyzing statistical patterns in tags, new approaches mix manual and automatic approaches to yield better results. \n</li><li>Communities matter. Some people have suggested that tagging works best when it\'s done for personal reasons. But it appears that the community around a tagging system is a major contributor to its health and success.  Active communities like the one at LibraryThing can help create robust and useful tag sets.\n<li>User-generated innovation. Where tags are implemented alongside data feeds a remarkable pattern of user-generated innovation occurs. Tags and feeds create a simple read-write system for any web application, allowing users to freely hack new features and extend the application. While this isn\'t news exactly, the consistency of this pattern across significantly different tagging systems suggests that it\'s important.</li>\n</li></ul>\n\nThe session will consist of real-world examples, sprinkled with academic theory, used in the book \"Tagging\".</p>','2008-04-12 10:30:00','2008-04-12 11:15:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2008-04-12','2008-04-12','10:30','11:15',1,NULL,1,NULL),(92,'What do innovative intranets look like?','<p>Intranets are almost always hidden from view.

With more people than ever before donning avatars, the global community of virtual world users continues to grow not only larger, but also more disparate, more inclusive, and more difficult to define or categorize. \r\r\r\rCreating and engaging these disparate audiences is a key challenge for virtual world designers and marketers, and a crucial success factor is the ability to listen to their large and diverse audience and understand exactly what users want from their chosen virtual world. \r\r\r\rAt any given moment in \"Gaia Online\":http://www.gaiaonline.com/, 100,000+ users may be online simultaneously. Some are there to play online games, others watch movies in a communal virtual cinema setting, chat in forums, personalize their avatars, or share their real-world art with virtual world admirers.\r\r\r\rIn order to understand these users, ongoing dialogue is essential. A simple user poll about the most popular celebrity in a particular virtual world might seem like just a bit of fun, but when the chosen celebrity makes a virtual appearance in the world at a later stage, marketers can be confident that their guest isn’t going to drive users away. \r\r\r\rSimilarly, while a virtual world’s forums and bulletin boards may seem an appropriately unruly and diverse sounding board for user opinion, they provide some of the best available insights into exactly what makes users tick, what unifies them, and what divides them. Indeed, marketers and developers who ignore the writing on the forum wall, do so at their own risk. \r\r\r\rBut as if defining a virtual world audience wasn’t hard enough, things become even more challenging when designers try to influence or shape the future direction of that audience or reach out to new audiences altogether. \r\r\r\rWith new users more curious than ever about virtual worlds, it makes sense for marketers to cozy up to these new audiences where they can. But existing users were attracted to their chosen virtual world for a reason, and marketers must be careful not to alienate their devoted users.\r\r\r\rIn these individualistic, user-driven environments, reaching out to new audiences, perhaps by introducing targeted narrative, episodic elements, and designer-generated content, must be done carefully. For the marketer, it is a balancing act: introduce too much structure and users might start to lose their sense of freedom in the virtual world. Introduce too little, and you are missing out on the opportunity to strategically reach out to new audiences and shape the virtual world’s future direction. \r\r\r\rIn this panel, leaders in the virtual world industry will discuss how they define, understand, and engage their audiences, what strategies they take in reaching out to new users, and how they maintain the delicate balance of capitalizing on market opportunities without losing touch with the anarchic, freeform focus that attracted their users in the first place. \r\r','2008-04-23 14:40:00','2008-04-23 15:30:00','2009',NULL,NULL,'2008-04-23','2008-04-23','14:40','15:30',1,NULL,3,'Marketing and Community'),(141,'Secure Session Management for Web Applications','Strong session management is a crucial part of a secure web application.

Yet for all its promise, this “Social Web” is still in many ways nascent and immature: users are increasingly frustrated at having to re-create profiles and re-establish relationships from scratch on every new site they visit; there is confusion over what type of control users should have of their own information and relationships, and when and how it’s appropriate to share that information with other people and services; and developers are still largely forced to choose between developing an independent site with little access to rich social information or “widgetizing” their app to deploy it inside an existing social network’s walled garden.\r\r\r\rAmidst this growing clamor of online social activity, a number of grass-roots technologies are emerging that would allow a more open and decentralized Social Web in which users can build a consolidated online identity that spans multiple tools and services and the data users create on each site can be made portable, so relationships established in one place can become meaningful and durable in other contexts, and in which users and developers no longer need to “start from scratch” in order to craft new social experiences, thus lowering the bar for innovation.\r\r\r\rThis talk will describe the social landscape as it stands, highlight the technologies that are changing what’s possible (including OpenID, OAuth, OpenSocial, and others), and illuminate the current debates over privacy, control, and portability that have made the emerging Social Web such a hotly discussed topic.

Four billion people live in fragile but growing economies. One in seven people live in slum settlements. All around the world there are talented designers who want to use their skills to help those in need. Now, thanks to the Open Architecture Network, they can.\r\r\r\rThe Open Architecture Network, (OAN), harnesses the best of Web 2.0 design concepts to allow architects and designers of all persuasions to collaborate with and inspire each other on designs that are changing people’s lives. Since the site was unveiled at the TED conference in March 2007, more than 8,000 people have joined the network to improve living conditions for people who have been victims of war, poverty, and natural disasters.\r\r\r\rOAN was the brainchild of Architecture for Humanity, a non-profit organization that seeks architectural solutions to humanitarian crises. In July 2006, Hot Studio, a user-centered design firm based in San Francisco, volunteered to lead the design effort for this new collaboration system. \r\r\r\rTo kick off the project, we flew to Biloxi, Mississippi, one of the cities ravaged by floods from Hurricane Katrina, to talk with people who lost their homes, and those who were leading rebuilding efforts. We’ll talk about how this intensive ethnographic research inspired our own design process, and led to tangible features that can be found on the OAN today.\r\r\r\rIn this case study, we hope to dispel some of the hype that surrounds Web 2.0, and show how user research can create breakthroughs in our thinking. It can lead us to design things that are about more than just employing the latest technology. It can ground us in the needs of real people, and help us to design things that can truly change people’s lives.\r\r\r\r','2008-04-25 14:40:00','2008-04-25 15:30:00','2008',NULL,NULL,'2008-04-25','2008-04-25','14:40','15:30',1,NULL,3,'Design and User Experience'),(209,'Checking the \"Feel\" of Your UI with an Interaction Audit','The best web sites feel smooth and predictable, yet powerful and deep. They achieve this by presenting a limited set of well-chosen interactions that support users throughout the experience. This lowers learning curves to near zero and allows users to concentrate on the content, which is what they’re really after.\r\r \r\rAs web sites evolve and offer users new interactions, it\'s important to take stock of how they behave, and whether those behaviors are consistent. It may be easy to achieve consistent interaction design for a new site, but when more established web sites introduce modern interactions it is frequently in an ad hoc manner, and users may be presented with a variety of methods—new and old—of accomplishing similar tasks. The resulting site can feel jagged and unpredictable, with a steep learning curve and low ease of use.\r\r \r\rTo correct this problem, designers may establish design patterns to describe the appropriate interactions a site should offer to support users\' objectives. But before that can happen, it\'s important to understand the current types of interactions being offered.\r\r \r\rUsing a recent audit of the interaction design of eBay.com as an example—an audit of the site\'s \"feel\"—we\'ll discuss how collecting and cataloging the variety of interactions can be an important precursor to establishing interaction design patterns for a highly trafficked web site.\r\r \r\rWe\'ll walk through the process used to quantify and describe interactions on the eBay site, starting with an audit of a representative sampling of user flows. Data gathered included variability in system response to user interactions with similar controls, multiple paths to accomplish similar tasks, and different representations of similar data objects.

However, these new applications will demand even greater cooperation and iteration between RIA designers and developers from beginning to end.\r\r\r\rOne challenge is that developers and designers take a very different approach to creating a new RIA experience. Developers start out by dragging components onto a form, whereas designers prefer a more free-form approach—drawing out what the UI and controls should feel like. Despite these different approaches, designers and developers are craving better ways to work together throughout the iterative process of creating rich internet experiences.\r\r\r\rIn this session, you’ll see a sneak-peak of the new RIA design tool under development at Adobe, codenamed “Thermo.” You’ll see how Thermo enables designers and developers to create working application prototypes starting with static comps created in traditional graphic design tools.\r\r\r\rThermo will change the way RIA design occurs by allowing a designer to specify fluid application transitions and motion. Properties and events can be “wired up” in an application design without having to write any code.

The Eclipse IDE was the first highly visible project to adopt OSGi technology a few years ago, but more and more projects are moving in the same direction (e.g., Directory, Spring, JOnAS) or considering it (e.g., Geronimo, JAMES, Jackrabbit). Now that Apache Felix has graduated from the incubator, there is no better time to start moving to OSGi technology. This talk will provide a status update on the Apache Felix project and will show in detail how to launch and embed the Apache Felix framework into your own projects and the issues around doing so. By attending this talk, you will receive enough information to immediately start using Apache Felix as a dynamically extensible plugin mechanism in your own applications, additionally providing them the benefits of module version management, dependency resolution, and life cycle control.','2008-04-09 14:00:00','2008-04-09 14:50:00','Matterhorn 2',NULL,NULL,'2008-04-09','2008-04-09','14:00','14:50',1,NULL,2,NULL),(268,'Open Source Collaboration Tools are Good For You!','Looking at how successful Open Source project teams work, one sees the importance of using the right collaboration tools in the right way. How does this translate to your in-house teams? Based on the distributed collaboration model used by the ASF projects, we have defined requirements for a set of collaboration tools, ranked according to their effect on the team\'s efficiency. Based on this analysis, we propose a migration path, for teams that need to move from an \"ask around the office\" development model to the efficient \"distributed self service information\" model used by the ASF and other Open Source organizations. Embracing the ASF way, in small steps if needed, might make a big difference in your programming teams efficiency, and in the quality of their work.

It usually requires a whole farm of dedicated application servers load-balanced by one or more frontend servers. Learn how to leverage the Apache HTTP server to implement a robust, secure and effective load-balancer to improve response times and to provide automatic failover for your critical services. Topics covered in this session include: connecting backend servers via HTTP or AJP, using several backend clusters by partioning the URL space, using rewrite rules to allow flexible request handling, using sticky sessions to provide persistence, using special headers to communicate with the backends, offloading SSL and filtering content, operating multiple frontends in one or more physical locations as well as general load-balancing algorithms, common caching strategies and browser-based management of the balancers. Some useful tips and a discussion of the most common pitfalls, based on real-world experience, will form the conclusion of the session.','2008-04-09 15:00:00','2008-04-09 15:50:00','Matterhorn 1',NULL,NULL,'2008-04-09','2008-04-09','15:00','15:50',1,NULL,2,NULL),(270,'Apache Wicket - web development with just Java','Why stop object oriented programming at the web tier?

One option to scale is using paid services of a content delivery network (CDN). This is often not affordable, especially for Open Source projects. Another way is building up a mirror infrastructore. But choosing an appropriate mirror is often left to the user, and mirrors might be out of date, incomplete, or unreliable. This talk shows how to build a poor man\'s CDN, using plain mirror servers and a redirecting Apache HTTP server. On the example of download.openSUSE.org, it shows how mirrored content can be transparently integrated into the web service, and how requests are redirected to geographically close mirrors using IP geolocation. The demonstrated infrastructure comprises means to scan mirrors and keeping track of present files in a MySQL database, active monitoring of mirrors, and mod_zrkadlo, a redirecting Apache module built upon the DBD framework. Along the way, the talk discusses different approaches in geographical redirection of bulk data, load sharing with weighted randomization, high availibility and scaling issues, mirror stickiness, and client side robustness. Also discussed are problems that have been encountered in real life, solutions and open questions.','2008-04-09 16:30:00','2008-04-09 17:20:00','Matterhorn 1',NULL,NULL,'2008-04-09','2008-04-09','16:30','17:20',1,NULL,2,NULL),(272,'Advanced JavaServer Faces - Using cool JSF Technologies','JavaServer Faces is now real, but there are some issues you have to be aware of, when using JSF inside your project.

This talk offers practical advice, garnered from real-life experience about how to measure and tune the performance of web applications, using free tools like JMeter, the Open Source load-tester from Apache. The talk will cover, planning your tests, setting up the tools, advise on what data to capture, how to interpret it and some of the possibilities for tuning your project. It will help you answer questions like : How many users will it take to break my site ? How can I handle more users, faster ? How reliable will my site be ?

LDAP server available for testing is not always an option, especially for tests in open source projects where anyone can download and run these tests in environments the developer is not in control of. Beside being a fully compliant LDAP server, ADS can also be seen as the perfect LDAP server when it comes to use it in development environment: it\'s embeddable for unit tests, fully LDAP v3 compliant, light, and easy to use. Hence there are many reasons why you should use ApacheDS before going to production. Many people are using Tomcat in production, but a lot more are using it during the development phase because it\'s light, easy to install, easy to use, and free of course. ApacheDS provides similar advantages. Furthermore the tooling ApacheDS offers (Apache Directory Studio) is very appealing.
