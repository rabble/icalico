SUMMARY:User-Generated Censorship
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Annalee Newitz (io9). User-generated censorship
  is what happens when crowds on social media networks flag content as "i
 nappropriate" and get it removed or hidden. This represents a break with
  traditional top-down censorship. But is user-generated censorship an im
 provement, or worse than Big Brother? We'll find out by looking at examp
 les from Flickr, YouTube, Craiglist, and more.
